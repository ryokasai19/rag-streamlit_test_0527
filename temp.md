# Team Handbook

## Collaboration

We use Slack for communication and Notion for documentation. Team members are encouraged to share updates daily.

## Security

All user data is encrypted using AES-256. Access to production requires 2FA.

## Deployment

We use GitHub Actions to deploy to AWS. Deployments are triggered on merge to `main`.
